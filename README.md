# Welcome to Dave Hydraulics and Hydrology!


## Introduction
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Solomon**, and I'd like to introduce you to a React project created for my friend, David. This is an educational site designed to disseminate information and lectures on the subjects of hydraulics and hydrology through a comprehensive platform. The project is built using the **React** framework, with additional components such as **SASS** for styling, **React-icons** for icons, **Material UI** components, and other essential packages. By thoroughly reading through this **README**, you'll gain the confidence needed to work on your projects. Feel free to use this project as a foundation, and don't hesitate to make modifications for further improvement.

## Components

This section outlines the key components used in the project, each serving a specific purpose.

### Layout Component

The `Layout` component is responsible for structuring the overall layout of the application. It may include common elements such as the header, footer, and navigation bar.

### Navbar Component

The `Navbar` component serves as the navigation bar for the application, providing links to different sections or pages. It enhances the user's ability to navigate through the site efficiently.

### Footer Component

The `Footer` component is responsible for displaying information at the bottom of the application, typically including copyright notices, links to relevant resources, or other pertinent information.

### Outlet Component

The `Outlet` component is a central point for rendering the content of different pages or sections. It dynamically displays the content based on the selected navigation or route.

Feel free to explore and modify these components to suit the specific requirements of your project. Each component is designed for reusability and can be customized to enhance the overall user experience.

## Usage

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
