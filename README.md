This React project was created for my friend, David. It serves as an educational platform dedicated to providing information and lectures on hydraulics and hydrology. The project utilizes the React framework and incorporates additional tools such as SASS for styling, React-icons for icons, and **Material UI** components, along with other essential packages. By thoroughly reviewing this README, you'll gain the confidence to tackle your own projects. Feel free to use this project as a foundation, and don't hesitate to make modifications to enhance it further.
