This is a React project created for my friend, David. This is an educational site designed to disseminate information and lectures on the subjects of hydraulics and hydrology through a comprehensive platform. The project is built using the **React** framework, with additional components such as **SASS** for styling, **React-icons** for icons, **Material UI** components, and other essential packages. By thoroughly reading through this **README**, you'll gain the confidence needed to work on your projects. Feel free to use this project as a foundation, and don't hesitate to make modifications for further improvement.
